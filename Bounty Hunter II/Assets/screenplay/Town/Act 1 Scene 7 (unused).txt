Peast: Come back here! I haven't finished with you, you meddling rat!
I... see... him... running...
I've spent 3 years of my life earning that...
Without this money... I can't eat.
I'll end up homeless...
I'll get that money no matter what...
Even if I'll have to travel to the other island in that sleeper train that blue haired man is going to.
