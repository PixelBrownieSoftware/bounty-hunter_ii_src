Peast: Ugh...
Does that blue haired jerk need to be such a chore to chase?
I just want him to give me back my money!
***Peast: Oi, you!
???: AHH!
***Peast: Come back here! I need my life-savings back from you!
???: Never!
My freinds, stop this crazy man!
Peast: Great... more fighting.
***Peast: Isn't he one of that theif's freinds?
Man: D-don't come close to me! I'll shoot you! 
Snakes: HISSSSSSSSSS!
Man: Alright, that does it! I'm pulling that trigger!
Peast: It dosen't seem like I'm the only one who's being attacked by these snakes...
***Peast: Hey! Hands up where I can see them!
???: Uh... hello, my name is Milbert... nice to-
Peast: Hands UP!
Milbert: Why?
Peast: Put down that money bag or I'll shoot you!
Milbert: I'm just trying to have a conversation, can't you take it easy here?
Peast: You've taken my life savings!
Milbert: So? You can just earn them back!
Peast: ....
I'm not playing around here, I worked hard for that money! I've got bills to pay!
Milbert: B-But I need that money!
Peast: For what?
Milbert: Because I'm erm... poor!
Leave me alone you nosy maggot!
If you keep chasing and threatening me, I-I'll beat you up!
I'll smack you silly! You hear me? I will!
Peast: Hmmm...
It won't be a battle you'll have any chance of winning, so give me my money or-
Milbert: GAAAAAHHHHH!! I'VE HAD IT WITH YOU!!
Taste my fury you imbecilic degenerate!!
***Milbert: Ugh... you really hurt me there...
Peast: You have underestimated me. I don't appreciate people stealing my money,
now, I've heard you saying that you were poor...
Milbert: You... you...
FOOL!
***Peast: Wha-
***Peast: (He got away...)
(I wanted to help him with his poverty, but he ran away with my money!)
(Milbert's not going to get away with this, I've spent 3 years earning this money!)
(I can't eat or pay my bills without it... I'm going to have to take some extreme measures to get it back!)
(Even if it will involve... a good amount of violence.)
***Milbert: Dang it pipe hole... open!
Gah...
There! Better run for it!
Inform my freinds that Peast is coming!
Peast: He must be getting into the sewers,
I'd better hurry.
