???: Oh? You seem like someone new here, not many people cross here.
???: I presume you must have gone through some great lengths to arrive at this jungle.
???: My name is Kazzi, I'm part of a group of travellers.
Peast: Have you by any chance seen a blue-haired, pale man?
Kazzi: I beleive I did pal, he was running with a bag of what seemed to be money.
Kazzi: He seemed like a very suspicious guy, when I tried talking to him
he threw a smoke bomb and before you know it, he's gone.
Peast: That's who I'm after, that money was my entire life savings.
Kazzi: I see... I'd be eager to help you through this jungle, because if I'll be perfectly honest with you, drawing from my weeks worth of expereince.
It's not safe here, there aren't any health kits here either.
Peast: I'm perfectly fine on my own. I do this kind of stuff for a living... I managed to travel across a long distance to fight a big demon.
Peast: So, how could you help me?
Kazzi: I've got lots of medication with me, as well as a pretty good weapon 
- handy for fighting the strongest of critters.
Peast: Okay then, but wouldn't I have extra weight to carry with your own health in mind?
Kazzi: Nah kido! You don't need to worry about me! I fight pretty well in the wilds... usually.
