???: Are you who I think you are?
Peast: Huh?

???: Yeah! You are Peast! It's been a while since I've seen you!
Peast: Kazzi?
Kazzi: How are you, pal?
Peast: Not particularly good.
Kazzi: Huh... what happened.
Peast: Basically I returned back home from work, and saw some fat blue haired person take my money.
Peast: He ran just as I saw him, and that's when I got mad and chased him.
Kazzi: I think I saw someone like that near the village up ahead.
Peast: Did you?
Peast: Was he carrying a bag of money?
Kazzi: Yeah.
Peast: Hmm...
Kazzi: So I presume you are here because you are chasing him, hey?
Peast: Pretty much.
Kazzi: I think that I should help you get your money back.
Kazzi: I wouldn't want to see a freind like you all broke.
Peast: I'm fine. Won't I be dragging you down and wasting your time if you try to assist me?
Kazzi: Nonsense! I'm sure we'll ambush him down swiftly.
Kazzi: Plus, didn't that blue haired guy take the train before you? The only way you could have arrived this quick was via the sewers, right?
Peast: Yes.
Kazzi: I'm pretty sure that was dangerous... it's not any better where that guy seems to be going.
Kazzi: There are loads of vipers in the jungle, they have poisionous venom which they can quickly eject at you with.
Kazzi: If you get hurt without me around, who's going to patch your wounds?
Peast: Good point... I didn't think of that...
Peast: It's probably best if I have someone to help me and... keep me company.
Kazzi: Okay then, let's get going then buddy.
