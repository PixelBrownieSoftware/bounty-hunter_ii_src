Jack: Paul.
Paul: What?
Jack: I've heard that there's some guy on the loose.
Paul: Everyone's on the loose, who in particular?
Jack: Our leader Milbert, told me that there is a guy who is chasing him.
He wears a orange-coloured suit and a shirt with the top buttons undone.
He's also carrying a pistol.
Paul: Do you think he's here?
Jack: I'm not too sure to be honest...
***Engineer: That's the man I told you about!
Paul: Oh crap! Get him!
***BZZZZZZT!!
Announcer: There is a orange-suited bounty hunter on the loose.
Any personel who sees him must beat him down to a pulp.
***BZZZZZZT!!
Announcer: He is getting closer to the docking base!
Anialate him at once.
If you are listening to this Peast, I am waiting for you near the docking base...
***???: Well well, if it isn't Peast- I am Velma, one of Milbert's associates.
I've designed the robots you may have fought, and I am really ashamed you have destoryed my hard work.
Peast: (They were going to kill me, what else was I supposed to do?)
Velma: You are not only a threat to my robots, but you are a threat to Milbert's plan to get us to the desert.
Where a rich and vast city resides.
We have been working so hard to bulid this airship, it took us time and money we had to go long ways to earn.
Peast: Wait, why did you take mine then, if you had income anyway?
Velma: It's easier if we take someone else's money rather than tire a lot of engineers just to get income,
especialy from a pretty rich person like you.
Peast: That dosen't mean you should steal from me!
Velma: Face it, you have nothing now. You don't really have any friends. It only made sense if we took your money.
Peast: Cut your taunts, you chump!
Velma: Your bullets are as effective as your insults. 
***Velma: You... you are stronger than I.. thought.
Velma: Curse you Alan... curse you...
He's leaving without us...
all because of you.
Peast: I'd better catch up!
