Peast: Uh?
Milbert: Not so fast there, mister!
My little freind Earl is going to deal with you, while I will run off! 
Have fun.
Peast: Curse you, fool!
Earl: Heh... you won't stand a chance against me, Peast. We know all about you, you're that successful bounty hunter who makes quite a humble living.
Peast: Who is "we"?
Earl: Those are not important details. For now all I care about is stopping you so that you no longer persist in chasing my master, Milbert.
Peast: It's unlikely you'll ever stop me. Do you know how skilled I am?
Earl: Ha! Ha! You are quite the arrogant one aren't you?
I'll show you how powerful I am, and you'll regret saying otherwise!
***Earl: Ugh... master... forgive me, I have failed you.
Peast: Where is your master?
Earl: I-I'll never tell you!
Peast: Do you want me to finish you off?
Earl: Fine, he's going to the hideout north of here, located in the Mesa. Don't kill me please. I'm still young.
Peast: Thanks for the information.
Earl: It's not like your going to survive anyway. Even if you do, you won't catch up with him.
Don't expect this to be the last time we meet, I will defeat you in the name of Milbert!
Peast: (He has some dedication to his master, huh.)
