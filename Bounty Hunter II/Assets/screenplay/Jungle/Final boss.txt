Milbert: I have kept this crystal to me for a while now,
I found this a long time ago - I can't remember where.
Stories have been told that this crystal can morph someone into something incredibly powerful...
Got any last words before, I obliterate you?
Peast: No.
Milbert: Good... I'll just kill you now!
***Demon Milbert: GRRRAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH!!!
***Demon Milbert: THIS...THISS... CANNOT BE...
AFTER... ALL I... COULD DO... YOU STILL... DEFEAT ME...
YOU... ARE AN... ID...I..
***Peast: Game over.
***Peast: Now... where's my money...
Maybe in these drawers...
..
Ah! I see it! 
Urg...
***Milbert: H-Hey!
What are you doing!
***Peast: Drat! He caught me!
Milbert: You are taking my money!
That's it!
YAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH!!!
***Peast: (Woah... that was close!)
Milbert: Look at what you made me done you fool!
You made me jam the yoke down, the airship is now going to descend and crash!
You shouldn't have followed me up here!
The money and my future will be destoryed!
I hope you like your tragic ending!
We're all going to die! 
This is all your fault!
***Peast: (Forget the money,)
(This is a very grim situation)
(There could be an escape nearby...)
(Or I could jump outside.)
(I think I still have ti-)

Peast and Milbert: AAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHH!
